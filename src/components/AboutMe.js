      Hi, I&#39;m Olaf! Iâ€™m a front-end developer and project manager
      with a background in payments and e-commerce. Most recent experience
      from an e-commerce company in Switzerland building a Marketplace and
      a Vendor Integration Platform. Worked several years for a company called
      Make Commerce building a payments platform from scratch. Strong background
      in software product and project management, but recently focused fully on
      development and specifically to JS and React.
